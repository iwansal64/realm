        <p class="smooth">Hi. I'm Ridwan Bagoes Setiawan. <b>I love programming!</b> <u>i started to learn programming at 14</u>. Until now, i think that day is one of the most important thing in my life. It's because when i started programming that day i thought i found my <u>passion</u>. The <q>productive thing</q> that i like! that i'll sacrifice time for learning it deeply instead of playing games, playing with friends, or watching animes.</p>
        <p class="smooth"><u>I like to make some projects for improving my programming skill</u>. I always searching time for learn something new about technology. When i go to school, when i go to my hometown, even when i go to mall or supermarket. I always want to improve my programming skills everywhere with whether using smartphone or laptop.</p>
        <p class="smooth"><u>My dream is become a FullStack Developer</u> because of that, there's no a single day in my life without learning programming. That's my <b>determination</b>. Even though sometimes it's frustrating, stressing, and makes me sick, I still never give up. I believe that there's myself in future that saying to me "You can do this! You're on the right path."</p>
